# Tic Tac Toe

This is basically just a demo of how to refactor a simple web app from how it may have been written in the "good old days" to something more modern.  

The intention with this is to 

* Demonstrate a refactoring workflow
* Demonstrate adding unit tests to a previously untested application
* Form the basis for further refactoring experiments, namely migrating a raw PHP app to various frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, etc)

The app itself isn't that interesting, as it's just a basic implementation of tic-tac-toe/naughts and crosses.  The real item of interest with this should be the commit log as it should ultimately show a progression from an old-school app to something more modern in iterative chunks.
